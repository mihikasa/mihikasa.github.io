# **Mihika Saxena** 💃

As a postgraduate student in Fashion Marketing at NTU, I thrive on organizing details and bringing structure to any project I work on. With a natural ability for managing tasks and keeping things running smoothly, I enjoy taking on roles that allow me to support teams and bring creative ideas to life. Having worked in digital marketing, fashion design, and styling, I’ve developed a love for both the creative and technical aspects of my work.
